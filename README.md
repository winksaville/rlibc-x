# rlibc-x

A minimal, educational Rust libc implementation for Linux x86_64.

## Goals

- **Educational** - Understand how Rust programs start, allocate memory, and interact with the
  kernel
- **Minimal binaries** - Explore whether simpler, focused implementations can produce smaller
  binaries than full-featured libcs
- **Eventually transparent** - Long-term goal is to not require `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` in
  applications

One hypothesis: if a CLI or GUI app doesn't parse command line arguments, a minimal runtime could
skip that machinery entirely, potentially reducing binary size significantly.

## Status

This is an experimental/educational project. For production use, consider mature alternatives:

- [relibc](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc) - Redox OS's portable POSIX C library
  written in Rust
- [c-ward](https://github.com/aspect-build/c-ward) - A libc implementation written in Rust

## Origin

I started this with this prompt for Claude Code 4.5:

> "I want to create a rust app that simply returns a number, something like `fn main -> i32 { 2 }`.
> I want to supply all code including the "standard libraries". I don't want the complication of
> code unwinding so panic="abort". So the minimum set of functions in lib.rs is _start, panic,
> exit, free, malloc, realloc, exit and probably a few others. And main.rs is something like
> `fn main() { exit(2) }`."

## Created by working with Claude Code 4.5

Thanks for the help Claude :)
